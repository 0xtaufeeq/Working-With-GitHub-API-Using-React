# Working-With-GitHub-API-Using-React
hello fren! here you can search for anyone's repositories on GitHub, be it your favorite developer or your "hater" who always steals your code!

## How to Use
1. Type in the GitHub username of the person you want to stalk...err, I mean, search their repositories for.
2. Hit that "Search" button like it's the last slice of pizza.
3. Watch as a list of their repositories appear, with stars and forks to show you how popular (or unpopular) their code is.
4. If you're feeling judgy, sort the repositories by stars or forks using the handy drop-down menu.
5. If you're feeling generous, go ahead and give them a star or fork. Or both. Or neither. I won't judge.
## Technology Used
- React - The best thing since sliced bread. Or garlic bread. Or...you get the point.
- GitHub API - The magical portal to all the code in the world. Or at least, all the code on GitHub.
- FontAwesome - Because who doesn't love pretty icons to jazz up their app? (And because I couldn't figure out how to make my own icons in time.)
## Future *Possible* Updates, If I Don't End Up Starting A New Project Every Weekend
1. Add a feature to allow users to comment on repositories. Because why should Reddit have all the fun?
2. Add a "Stalker Mode" that lets you follow your favorite developers and receive notifications when they commit new code.
3. Add an "Easter Egg" that launches a game of Snake when you hit a secret key combination.
